# 🧠 LeetCode Daily Challenge Solutions

Welcome to my **LeetCode Daily Challenge** repository!

Every day, I solve the daily challenge on [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com) and automatically post the question details and my solution here using a custom script and GitHub Actions.

## 📅 What You’ll Find Here

- A folder for **each day's** problem under `/daily/`
